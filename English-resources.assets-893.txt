MAR_MEDALLION_PICKUP_H1=I used the claw inside the submarine in the Maritime Room to pull a figurehead out of the moon pool. There's something hanging around its neck...
MAR_MEDALLION_OPEN_H1=The pendant I found seems to have something inside it.
MAR_MEDALLION_OPEN_H2=The pendant has four clasps on it's back. Perhaps I can pry them open...
MAR_PEARL_PICKUP_H1=Now the clasps on that pendant I found are open, I should take what's inside it. 
MAR_HARPOON_PLACE_H1=This harpoon I found must have once been used on a large fishing boat. 
MAR_HARPOON_PLACE_H2=This harpoon must belong somewhere in the Maritime Room. It's not the sort of thing to be thrown by hand, though.
MAR_HARPOON_PLACE_H3=There's a harpoon gun in the corner of the Maritime Room! I can probably load this harpoon into it.
MAR_HARPOON_LOAD_H1=The harpoon gun in the Maritime Room is loaded but not primed. I'll need to pull back the lever on its right side to do that. 
MAR_HARPOON_FIRE_H1=The harpoon gun in the Maritime Room is loaded and primed. I should be able to fire it using the trigger above its handle.
MAR_PROPELLER=A small propeller
MAR_SUB_FIN=A metal fin
MAR_RADIO_VALVE=A vacuum tube
MAR_PEARL=A pearl
MAR_MEDALLION=A pendant with a map design
MAR_HEART=An artificial heart
MAR_UNSOLVED_BELL_PLACED=It almost fits! I should take a closer look...
MAR_SUB_FRONTFIN_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=The front fin is missing.
MAR_SUB_PROPELLER_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=Something's missing here...
MAR_RADIOVALVE_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=One of the vacuum tubes is missing.
MAR_BELL_RECIEVER_MESSAGE=I think one of the gears is missing.
MAR_HARPOON_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=It's a kind of gun, but nothing's loaded into it. 
MAR_SUB_DOORHANDLE_MESSAGE=It seems to be jammed...

CLOSED_MESSAGE_FOY_MAIN=I have found the seal my employers spoke of. It is weakened, but far from broken.\\nI am clearly on the path to finding the Null element. 
CLOSED_MESSAGE_STU_MAIN=A room dense with obsession, a study can be a refuge or a prison. I have walked free of its bars, but my task remains. Break the seal, find the Null. \\n\\n  
CLOSED_MESSAGE_CUR_MAIN=Darkness is darkness, no matter which corner of the globe it creeps from. The room is closed, but only just; true evidence that one's curiosity can be one's undoing.  \\n\\n 
CLOSED_MESSAGE_KIT_MAIN=The valves to the heart of this house are now blocked, yet still it breathes. As each room closes, the seal weakens and I am one step closer to the Null.
CLOSED_MESSAGE_MAR_MAIN=What lies below will inexorably claw its way above, dragging the helpless back down with them. I have scoured the depths beneath the waves and emerged gasping.
CLOSED_MESSAGE_GAR_MAIN=A trap so gradual, so divine, its victims are oblivious till the end. The shackles of the earth could not bind me, but I have felt their thorns pierce my skin.

STU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_01_H1=There's something strange set into the right side of the roll top desk in the Study. I should investigate.
STU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_01_H2=I can move that brass slider in the side of the rolltop desk up to three different tiles. The pictures on each tile look like some kind of sequence.
STU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_01_H3=An acorn grows into a sapling, which grows into a tree... I must need to use the slider to activate the tiles in that order!
STU_DESK_PULLOUT_PANEL_H1=A handle popped out the front of the roll top desk in the Study. Looks like I can pull something out.
STU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_01_EYEPIECE_H1=There's a shimmering panel on the roll top desk in the Study. I should try my eyepiece.  
STU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_01_H1=That strange object visible through my eyepiece in the Study's roll top desk looks like it has moving parts. It seems I can spin its base, too. 
STU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_01_H2=There are markings all around that object. If I spin its corners, I should be able to match them up. 
STU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_02_H1=There's a brass slider set into the right side of the roll top desk in the Study. I used it earlier, but something about it has changed.
STU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_02_H2=There's something on the side of that drawer beside the brass slider... it's path has extended!
STU_DESK_FIRESTRIKER_PICKUP_H1=A compartment popped open on that drawer in the Study's roll top desk. There's something inside. 
STU_DESK_PULL_UP_PANEL_OPEN_H1=What's that recess in the top of that drawer in the roll top desk in the Study? There's a handle there. 
STU_DESK_MEDALLION_PICKUP_H1=I should investigate that safe in the far left corner of the Study...
STU_DESK_MEDALLION_PICKUP_H2=The safe is locked, but there's a drawer just beneath it.
STU_DESK_MEDALLION_PICKUP_H3=There's something in that drawer beneath the safe in the study. I should take it. 
STU_DESK_MEDALION_PLACE_H1=I have a feeling that wooden medallion I found belongs somewhere on the roll top desk in the Study.
STU_DESK_MEDALION_PLACE_H2=That wooden medallion has four holes in it... it must fit somewhere with four prongs.   
STU_DESK_MEDALION_PLACE_H3=I opened a panel on the roll top desk which had four prongs jutting out from it. The medallion must fit there!
STU_DESK_MEDALION_OPEN_H1=The medallion is in place on the roll top desk in the Study... there must be more to it. 
STU_DESK_MEDALION_OPEN_H2=Is that a dial around the medallion? I should try spinning it. 
STU_DESK_CROSSWRENCH_PICKUP_H1=I opened that medallion on the roll top desk! There was something hidden inside.
STU_DESK_CROSSWRENCH_PLACE_H1=The shaped metal piece I found looks like it could fit somewhere on the roll top desk in the Study.
STU_DESK_CROSSWRENCH_PLACE_H2=That metal piece has something protruding from its back... it must fit in a cross-shaped socket. 
STU_DESK_CROSSWRENCH_PLACE_H3=There's a kind of lock on the left side of the roll top desk. It has a cross-shaped socket, so the metal piece must fit there!
STU_DESK_CROSSWRENCH_ROTATE_H1=The lock on the left side of the roll top desk in the Study has a handle now. I think I can rotate it.
STU_DESK_LEFT_PANEL_OPEN_H1=I unlocked a panel on the left side of the roll top desk in the Study. I should open it. 
STU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_02_EYEPIECE_H1=There's another shimmering panel on the roll top desk in the Study. I should view it through my eyepiece.  
STU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_02_H1=That strange object I can see through my eyepiece in the study's roll top desk seems to have more moving parts than the last one. Looks like I can also rotate its base.
STU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_02_H2=There are markings all over the surface of that object. If I spin its corners, I should be able to match them up. 
STU_DESK_SECRET_BUTTON_H1=A large curved section emerged from the roll top desk in the Study. Is that a button on its side?
STU_DESK_SECRET_DRAWER_H1=A small drawer popped out the side of that large curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. Is that another drawer inside it?   
STU_DESK_SECRET_DRAWER_H2=That small drawer seems to be attached to the panel above it... there's something's blocking it.
STU_DESK_SECRET_DRAWER_H3=Those brass studs are blocking the small drawer. Pushing them down should let me open it.   
STU_DESK_CARDEN_HANDLE_PICKUP_H1=I've unlocked that small drawer in the side of the curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. I should take what's inside.
STU_DESK_CARDEN_HATCH_LATCH_H1=There's some kind of hatch on top of that curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. It's held shut by a latch, though.
STU_DESK_CARDEN_HATCH_H1=I've unlocked the hatch on top of that curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. I should see what's beneath it. 
STU_DESK_CARDEN_HANDLE_PLACE_H1=There's an assortment of gears on top of the curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. There's nothing to drive them, though.
STU_DESK_CARDEN_HANDLE_PLACE_H2=I should be able to drive those gears with that crank handle I found!
STU_DESK_CARDEN_GEARS_H1=Those sliding tokens on the left side of the roll top desk seem to have matching sockets.
STU_DESK_CARDEN_GEARS_H2=Each of these tokens matches only one socket on the board...
STU_DESK_CARDEN_GEARS_H3=Turning that crank handle lets me move tokens from one side to the other and always changes their orientation.
STU_DESK_WELL_PICKUP_H1=A handle popped out the top of the curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. Pulling on it might reveal something.
STU_DESK_INKWELL_PLACE_H1=I found an inkwell in the kitchen, but it certainly doesn't belong in that room. 
STU_DESK_INKWELL_PLACE_H2=An inkwell like this must belong on a writing desk.
STU_DESK_INKWELL_PLACE_H3=There's a roll top desk in the Study! The inkwell must belong on that small bookshelf on its right side. 
STU_DESK_INKWELL_LID_H1=The inkwell in the roll top desk in the Study unlocked. I should open its lid all the way.
STU_DESK_INKWELL_BUTTON_H1=Now I've opened the inkwell's lid on the desk in the Study, I can press the button inside it. 
STU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H1=That central panel on the front of the roll top desk in the Study is still locked. Those disks at its corners are holding it shut. 
STU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H2=Some of the drawers on the roll top desk have a strange symbol on them... they might have something to do with that central panel.
STU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H3=I remember seeing one of those disks rotate when opening a drawer on the roll top desk...
STU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H4=I think I can arrange each drawer marked with a symbol so its corresponding disk doesn't block the desk's central panel.
STU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_OPEN_H1=Now the central panel on the front of the roll top desk in the Study is unlocked, I just need to pull it open.
STU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_H1=Using my eyepiece to enter the strange aperture on the Study's roll top desk revealed an internal mechanism. I need to get the giant gear at the bottom of the far wall spinning.
STU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_H2=I can use these levers to move the gear along the path. Once it's made contact with another gear, I can rotate the wheel to move sections of the path. 
STU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_H3=Once I've constructed a complete central path, I just need to take the moving gear down to the large gear and rotate the wheel.
STU_DESK_PUMP_TOP_PICKUP_H1=A small compartment opened on the front of the roll top desk in the Study, just beneath the central panel. There's something inside. 
STU_FIRST_STEAM_PIPE_H1=I've redirected the water supply into the Kitchen's boiler. But where does the water go after being boiled?
STU_FIRST_STEAM_PIPE_H2=The brass pipes in the Kitchen seem to lead to different room. I should follow the trail...
STU_FIRST_STEAM_PIPE_H3=The steam is flowing into the Study! Inside is a pipe with a handle coming out of the left wall. I should pull down on it to secure the connection.
STU_MINI_PISTON_H1=Steam is now flowing into a piston cylinder in the Study.  If I move the handles either side of it, steam can escape...
STU_MINI_PISTON_H2=The steam needs to enter the pipe on the next table. There's a metal wedge with a handle above the pivoting arm...
STU_MINI_PISTON_H3=I should fill the piston with steam, then lock the pipe into position using the metal wedge. I can then turn both handles to open the valves.
STU_AEOLIPILE_H1=There's a brass orb with pipes sticking out of it on the left side of the  Study. It seems to drive that mechanism to its right when it spins.
STU_AEOLIPILE_H2=I can use the handle beneath the orb to stop or start the steam. The exhaust pipes on the orb can rotate, too...
STU_AEOLIPILE_H3=I should rotate the orb's exhaust pipes so that they point in the same direction - then activate the steam!
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_DOOR_H1=The steam-powered brass orb in the Study is spinning fast enough to raise the bar blocking the safe. I should be able to open it now...
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_DOOR_OPEN_H1=I've unlocked the door to the safe, I just need to open it...
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_H1=I managed to unlock the safe on the left side of the Study. There's something inside...
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_PLACED_H1=I found a pipe connector. Have I seen anything else with three pipes?
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_PLACED_H2=I routed the steam into the brass orb in the Study. Can I route it any further?
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_PLACED_H3=I should rotate the exhaust pipes on the brass orb so they point upwards. Then I can attach the pipe connector!
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_CONNECT_H1=I saw a pipe above the steam powered brass orb in the Study. There's a handle on the side...
STU_TRIPLEPIPE_TURN_ON_STEAM_H1=I've connected the pipe above the brass orb in the Study, I just need to turn on the steam using the handle below it.
STU_STEAMENGINE_H1=I routed the steam into the large machine at the rear of the Study. The wheel looks like it should be spinning...
STU_STEAMENGINE_H2=There are two valve handles either side of the machine. I'll need to use them to get it started.
STU_STEAMENGINE_H3=That third handle on top of the machine is unlocked now! Turning that should activate the machine fully.
STU_FINAL_PICKUP_H1=The wheel on the machine at the rear of the study is finally turning fast enough for me to take what's inside!
STU_TRAIN_PLACE_WHEEL_H1=A model appeared out of the desk in the Study! It seems to be missing a wheel.
STU_TRAIN_COUPLING_ROD_H1=After I placed the wheel on the model train in the Study, the coupling rod was unlocked. I should be able to rotate it and connect the back wheels together.
STU_TRAIN_BACK_WHEEL_PUZZLE_H1=I think the coupling rod on the rear wheels of the train in the Study are in the wrong position. It should probably be connected to the circular gold socket.
STU_TRAIN_BACK_WHEEL_PUZZLE_H2=I can spin the gold dial to complete either path on the rear wheel. Moving the coupling rod along a completed path will let me turn both wheels together...
STU_TRAIN_BACK_WHEEL_PUZZLE_H3=With the coupling rod at the end of a path, I should rotate both wheels one notch. I can then centre the rod, rotate the wheel back a notch, and repeat until the rod meets the gold socket.
STU_TRAIN_BUFFER_PICKUP_H1=I small compartment opened on the side of the train in the Study. I should pick up the object inside.
STU_TRAIN_BUFFER_PLACED_H1=This metal stud resembles something I've seen on the model train in the Study. 
STU_TRAIN_BUFFER_PLACED_H2=The train is missing a buffer at the back, I wonder if the metal stud would fit?
