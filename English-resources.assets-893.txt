Can I touch these apparitions?\r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_DRAGONJAWS_H1=The dragon statues in the Japanese Gallery appear to have articulated jaws. Perhaps I could find a use for that.\r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_FIRSTTOWER_GRAB_H1=The Japanese Gallery's stone table has a tower in the middle. I think it could be lifted up, with enough force...\r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_FIRSTTOWER_GRAB_H2=When I examine the wooden panels through my eyepiece, I can see spectral creatures. Their movements seem to affect these dragon statues.\r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_FIRSTTOWER_GRAB_H3=I think one of the dragons can reach the bar on the tower.

Then I'll close the jaws...\r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_FIRSTTOWER_DRAWER_H1=I found a drawer under a tower on the stone table in the Japanese Gallery. But it's sealed with metal chains.\r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_FIRSTTOWER_DRAWER_H2=If I spin the dial beneath the drawer, it faces a different direction. But is there a way to open it? \r\nJPN_DRAGONTABLE_FIRSTTOWER_DRAWER_H3=If I use my eyepiece on the wooden panel on the right side, I can move the dragon towards the drawer.

Perhaps there's some way to use the claw to grab hold of the door?\r\nMAR_SUBMARINE_CLAW_OPEN_DOOR_H3=I can adjust the fins on the side of the model submarine to tilt it forward and back. This must have an effect on everything inside it...\r\nMAR_SUBMARINE_CLAW_OPEN_DOOR_H4=With the submarine tilted forward, I can lower the claw so it attaches to the handle of the door! Then I just need to raise the claw again...\r\nMAR_SUBMARINE_CLAW_LOWERINTOMOOLPOOL_H1=The moon pool opened inside the main part of the submarine. What could be down there?\r\nMAR_SUBMARINE_CLAW_LOWERINTOMOOLPOOL_H2=Perhaps if I lowered the claw into the moon pool, it might latch on to something. Then I'd just need to bring it back up. \r\nMAR_RADIOVALVE_PICKUP_H1=I managed to open a door in the model submarine in the Maritime Room. I should have a look around inside.\r\nMAR_RADIOVALVE_PICKUP_H2=There's something in the control room, to the left of the submarine's controls. I should pick it up. \r\nMAR_RADIOVALVE_PLACED_H1=Something's missing from that radio in the Maritime Room. I wonder if there's a way to get it working?\r\nMAR_RADIOVALVE_PLACED_H2=The radio is missing a vacuum tube! I should try using the one I found.\r\nMAR_RADIO_SWITCH_H1=Now the radio in the Maritime Room has a full set of vacuum tubes, I should use that brass switch to turn it on.\r\nMAR_RADIO_SWITCH_AGAIN_H1=I should turn the radio in the Maritime Room on.\r\nMAR_RADIO_H1=The radio is working in the Maritime Room, but it's not tuned to anything.\r\nMAR_RADIO_H2=If I turn the radio's dial slowly, I'll be able to listen out for any changes in the static.  \r\nMAR_RADIO_H3=When the radio's needle passed over the eighty kilocycles per second mark, I thought I heard a change in the static...\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_BELL_RECEIVER_H1=The metal this bell is made from reminds me of something I saw in the Maritime Room... \r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_BELL_RECEIVER_H2=The bell I found has teeth like a gear now... the strongbox is covered in gears! It must fit somewhere there. \r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_BELL_RECEIVER_H3=There's a set of three gears on the left side of the strongbox... the bell looks like it would fit right between them.\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_PLANETARY_GEARS_H1=There are a set of three engraved gears on the strongbox in the Maritime Room. I can rotate them using the surrounding ring or the bell in the centre, but how should they be orientated?\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_PLANETARY_GEARS_H2=The engravings on the gears appear on the opposite side of the strongbox! I must have to orientate the gears to match.\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_TOP_LID_H1=A panel on the top of the strongbox in the Maritime Room unlocked. I should open it. \r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_TOP_GEAR_PEG_H1=There's a gear with a handle on top of the strongbox in the Maritime Room, but it doesn't seem connected to the rest of the mechanism.\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_TOP_GEAR_PEG_H2=If I slide the gold peg on the second gear all the way to the edge, it should then connect with the rest of the mechanism when I turn the handle.\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_FRONT_HATCH_LOCKS_H1=I think the mechanism on the front of the strongbox in the Maritime Room is some kind of lock. It seems connected to the gears on top of the box.\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_FRONT_HATCH_LOCKS_H2=Rotating the handle on top of the box turns the large gear on the front. The gear seems to be blocking those three sliding bolts. \r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_FRONT_HATCH_LOCKS_H3=There's a gap in the gear on the front of the box! When the gap is over a bolt, I should be able to slide it out. \r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_FRONT_HATCH_H1=I unlocked the hatch on the front the strongbox in the Maritime Room. It should just swing open.\r\nMAR_STRONGBOX_FRONT_COCK_H1=There's some kind of fire striker in the front of the strongbox in the Maritime Room. Can I use it to create a spark?\r\nMAR_FINALITEM_PICKUP_H1=I opened the strongbox in the Maritime Room! There's another one of those strange artifacts inside.\r\nMAR_SUBSZ_MAP_PUZZLE_H1=I got a pair of numbers and letters from the anatomical model in the Curiosity Room. They look like coordinates..\r\nMAR_SUBSZ_MAP_PUZZLE_H2=Coordinates are often used by navigators when travelling the ocean. Perhaps these coordinates are connected to something in the Maritime Room.  \r\nMAR_SUBSZ_MAP_PUZZLE_H3=When I used my eypeice to go inside the model submarine in the Maritime Room, I saw a map. What would happen if I set those wheels to the coordinates I found?\r\nMAR_HOLOSEA_SUB_EYEPIECE_H1=The porthole inside the model submarine in the Maritime room took on a strange sheen. I should try my eyepiece.  \\n\\n \r\nMAR_HOLOSEA_SUB_H1=My eyepiece reveals an ocean floor through the porthole inside the submarine in the Maritime Room! The wheel and lever in the control room change the vessel's depth and heading.\r\nMAR_HOLOSEA_SUB_H2=There's debris all over the ocean floor... I wonder if it'll lead me to anything.\r\nMAR_HOLOSEA_SUB_H3=The debris leads to a ship wreck with a strange, broken symbol above it. I need to manoeuvre the submarine to form the whole symbol.\r\nMAR_MEDALLION_PICKUP_H1=I used the claw inside the submarine in the Maritime Room to pull a figurehead out of the moon pool. There's something hanging around its neck...\r\nMAR_MEDALLION_OPEN_H1=The pendant I found seems to have something inside it.\r\nMAR_MEDALLION_OPEN_H2=The pendant has four clasps on it's back. Perhaps I can pry them open...\r\nMAR_PEARL_PICKUP_H1=Now the clasps on that pendant I found are open, I should take what's inside it. \r\nMAR_HARPOON_PLACE_H1=This harpoon I found must have once been used on a large fishing boat. \r\nMAR_HARPOON_PLACE_H2=This harpoon must belong somewhere in the Maritime Room. It's not the sort of thing to be thrown by hand, though.\r\nMAR_HARPOON_PLACE_H3=There's a harpoon gun in the corner of the Maritime Room! I can probably load this harpoon into it.\r\nMAR_HARPOON_LOAD_H1=The harpoon gun in the Maritime Room is loaded but not primed. I'll need to pull back the lever on its right side to do that. \r\nMAR_HARPOON_FIRE_H1=The harpoon gun in the Maritime Room is loaded and primed. I should be able to fire it using the trigger above its handle.\r\nMAR_PROPELLER=A small propeller\r\nMAR_SUB_FIN=A metal fin\r\nMAR_RADIO_VALVE=A vacuum tube\r\nMAR_PEARL=A pearl\r\nMAR_MEDALLION=A pendant with a map design\r\nMAR_HEART=An artificial heart\r\nMAR_UNSOLVED_BELL_PLACED=It almost fits! I should take a closer look...\r\nMAR_SUB_FRONTFIN_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=The front fin is missing.\r\nMAR_SUB_PROPELLER_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=Something's missing here...\r\nMAR_RADIOVALVE_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=One of the vacuum tubes is missing.\r\nMAR_BELL_RECIEVER_MESSAGE=I think one of the gears is missing.\r\nMAR_HARPOON_RECEIVER_MESSAGE=It's a kind of gun, but nothing's loaded into it. \r\nMAR_SUB_DOORHANDLE_MESSAGE=It seems to be jammed...\r\nLANGUAGE_NAME=English\r\nLANGUAGE_NAME_UPPERCASE=English\r\nHUD_INV_ITEM_FOUND=inventory object found\r\nHUD_TUTORIAL_TITLE=TUTORIAL\r\nHUD_HINT_TITLE=CLUE\r\nPAUSE_MAIN_TITLE=GAME PAUSED\r\nPAUSE_MAIN_RESUME=Resume\r\nPAUSE_MAIN_RESTART=Restart Chapter\r\nPAUSE_MAIN_QUIT=Quit\r\nPAUSE_QUIT_TITLE=QUIT GAME\r\nPAUSE_QUIT_CONFIRM=Are you sure you want to quit to the main menu?\\nYour progress will be saved.\r\nPAUSE_QUIT_QUIT=Quit Game\r\nPAUSE_QUIT_CANCEL=Cancel\r\nPAUSE_RESTART_TITLE=RESTART CHAPTER\r\nPAUSE_RESTART_CONFIRM=Are you sure you want to restart the current chapter?\\nAll progress will be lost.\r\nPAUSE_RESTART_RESTART=Restart Chapter\r\nPAUSE_RESTART_CANCEL=Cancel\r\nPAUSE_SKIP_CHAPTER_TITLE=SKIP CHAPTER\r\nPAUSE_SKIP_CHAPTER_MESSAGE=Are you sure you want to skip the current chapter?\r\nPAUSE_SKIP_CHAPTER_YES=Skip Chapter\r\nPAUSE_SKIP_CHAPTER_NO=Cancel\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_LINE_1=chapter\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_LINE_2=CompletE\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_CONTINUE=Continue\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_FACEBOOK=Facebook\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_TWITTER=Twitter\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_RATE=rate The Room: Old Sins\r\nCHAPTER_COMPLETE_QUIT=Quit\r\nGAME_COMPLETE_LINE_1=game\r\nGAME_COMPLETE_LINE_2=CompletE\r\nTHANKS_FOR_PLAYING=thank you for playing\r\nENDGAME_CONGRATS_MESSAGE=Congratulations, you have completed The Room 4: Old Sins.

It is weakened, but far from broken.\\nI am clearly on the path to finding the Null element. \r\nCLOSED_MESSAGE_STU_MAIN=A room dense with obsession, a study can be a refuge or a prison. I have walked free of its bars, but my task remains. Break the seal, find the Null. \\n\\n  \r\nCLOSED_MESSAGE_CUR_MAIN=Darkness is darkness, no matter which corner of the globe it creeps from.

The pictures on each tile look like some kind of sequence.\r\nSTU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_01_H3=An acorn grows into a sapling, which grows into a tree... I must need to use the slider to activate the tiles in that order!\r\nSTU_DESK_PULLOUT_PANEL_H1=A handle popped out the front of the roll top desk in the Study. Looks like I can pull something out.\r\nSTU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_01_EYEPIECE_H1=There's a shimmering panel on the roll top desk in the Study.

It seems I can spin its base, too. \r\nSTU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_01_H2=There are markings all around that object. If I spin its corners, I should be able to match them up. \r\nSTU_DESK_SLIDER_CODE_02_H1=There's a brass slider set into the right side of the roll top desk in the Study.

It has a cross-shaped socket, so the metal piece must fit there!\r\nSTU_DESK_CROSSWRENCH_ROTATE_H1=The lock on the left side of the roll top desk in the Study has a handle now. I think I can rotate it.\r\nSTU_DESK_LEFT_PANEL_OPEN_H1=I unlocked a panel on the left side of the roll top desk in the Study. I should open it. \r\nSTU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_02_EYEPIECE_H1=There's another shimmering panel on the roll top desk in the Study. I should view it through my eyepiece.  \r\nSTU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_02_H1=That strange object I can see through my eyepiece in the study's roll top desk seems to have more moving parts than the last one. Looks like I can also rotate its base.\r\nSTU_DESK_HOLOGRAM_02_H2=There are markings all over the surface of that object. If I spin its corners, I should be able to match them up. \r\nSTU_DESK_SECRET_BUTTON_H1=A large curved section emerged from the roll top desk in the Study. Is that a button on its side?\r\nSTU_DESK_SECRET_DRAWER_H1=A small drawer popped out the side of that large curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. Is that another drawer inside it?   \r\nSTU_DESK_SECRET_DRAWER_H2=That small drawer seems to be attached to the panel above it... there's something's blocking it.\r\nSTU_DESK_SECRET_DRAWER_H3=Those brass studs are blocking the small drawer. Pushing them down should let me open it.   \r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_HANDLE_PICKUP_H1=I've unlocked that small drawer in the side of the curved section of the roll top desk in the Study.

It's held shut by a latch, though.\r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_HATCH_H1=I've unlocked the hatch on top of that curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. I should see what's beneath it. \r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_HANDLE_PLACE_H1=There's an assortment of gears on top of the curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. There's nothing to drive them, though.\r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_HANDLE_PLACE_H2=I should be able to drive those gears with that crank handle I found!\r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_GEARS_H1=Those sliding tokens on the left side of the roll top desk seem to have matching sockets.\r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_GEARS_H2=Each of these tokens matches only one socket on the board...\r\nSTU_DESK_CARDEN_GEARS_H3=Turning that crank handle lets me move tokens from one side to the other and always changes their orientation.\r\nSTU_DESK_WELL_PICKUP_H1=A handle popped out the top of the curved section of the roll top desk in the Study. Pulling on it might reveal something.\r\nSTU_DESK_INKWELL_PLACE_H1=I found an inkwell in the kitchen, but it certainly doesn't belong in that room. \r\nSTU_DESK_INKWELL_PLACE_H2=An inkwell like this must belong on a writing desk.\r\nSTU_DESK_INKWELL_PLACE_H3=There's a roll top desk in the Study! The inkwell must belong on that small bookshelf on its right side. \r\nSTU_DESK_INKWELL_LID_H1=The inkwell in the roll top desk in the Study unlocked. I should open its lid all the way.\r\nSTU_DESK_INKWELL_BUTTON_H1=Now I've opened the inkwell's lid on the desk in the Study, I can press the button inside it. \r\nSTU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H1=That central panel on the front of the roll top desk in the Study is still locked. Those disks at its corners are holding it shut. \r\nSTU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H2=Some of the drawers on the roll top desk have a strange symbol on them... they might have something to do with that central panel.\r\nSTU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H3=I remember seeing one of those disks rotate when opening a drawer on the roll top desk...\r\nSTU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_SPINNERS_H4=I think I can arrange each drawer marked with a symbol so its corresponding disk doesn't block the desk's central panel.\r\nSTU_DESK_CENTRAL_PANEL_OPEN_H1=Now the central panel on the front of the roll top desk in the Study is unlocked, I just need to pull it open.\r\nSTU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_H1=Using my eyepiece to enter the strange aperture on the Study's roll top desk revealed an internal mechanism. I need to get the giant gear at the bottom of the far wall spinning.\r\nSTU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_H2=I can use these levers to move the gear along the path. Once it's made contact with another gear, I can rotate the wheel to move sections of the path. \r\nSTU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_H3=Once I've constructed a complete central path, I just need to take the moving gear down to the large gear and rotate the wheel.\r\nSTU_DESK_PUMP_TOP_PICKUP_H1=A small compartment opened on the front of the roll top desk in the Study, just beneath the central panel. There's something inside. \r\nSTU_FIRST_STEAM_PIPE_H1=I've redirected the water supply into the Kitchen's boiler. But where does the water go after being boiled?\r\nSTU_FIRST_STEAM_PIPE_H2=The brass pipes in the Kitchen seem to lead to different room. I should follow the trail...\r\nSTU_FIRST_STEAM_PIPE_H3=The steam is flowing into the Study! Inside is a pipe with a handle coming out of the left wall. I should pull down on it to secure the connection.\r\nSTU_MINI_PISTON_H1=Steam is now flowing into a piston cylinder in the Study.  If I move the handles either side of it, steam can escape...\r\nSTU_MINI_PISTON_H2=The steam needs to enter the pipe on the next table. There's a metal wedge with a handle above the pivoting arm...\r\nSTU_MINI_PISTON_H3=I should fill the piston with steam, then lock the pipe into position using the metal wedge. I can then turn both handles to open the valves.\r\nSTU_AEOLIPILE_H1=There's a brass orb with pipes sticking out of it on the left side of the  Study. It seems to drive that mechanism to its right when it spins.\r\nSTU_AEOLIPILE_H2=I can use the handle beneath the orb to stop or start the steam. The exhaust pipes on the orb can rotate, too...\r\nSTU_AEOLIPILE_H3=I should rotate the orb's exhaust pipes so that they point in the same direction - then activate the steam!\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_DOOR_H1=The steam-powered brass orb in the Study is spinning fast enough to raise the bar blocking the safe. I should be able to open it now...\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_DOOR_OPEN_H1=I've unlocked the door to the safe, I just need to open it...\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_H1=I managed to unlock the safe on the left side of the Study. There's something inside...\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_PLACED_H1=I found a pipe connector. Have I seen anything else with three pipes?\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_PLACED_H2=I routed the steam into the brass orb in the Study. Can I route it any further?\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_PLACED_H3=I should rotate the exhaust pipes on the brass orb so they point upwards. Then I can attach the pipe connector!\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_CONNECT_H1=I saw a pipe above the steam powered brass orb in the Study. There's a handle on the side...\r\nSTU_TRIPLEPIPE_TURN_ON_STEAM_H1=I've connected the pipe above the brass orb in the Study, I just need to turn on the steam using the handle below it.\r\nSTU_STEAMENGINE_H1=I routed the steam into the large machine at the rear of the Study. The wheel looks like it should be spinning...\r\nSTU_STEAMENGINE_H2=There are two valve handles either side of the machine. I'll need to use them to get it started.\r\nSTU_STEAMENGINE_H3=That third handle on top of the machine is unlocked now! Turning that should activate the machine fully.\r\nSTU_FINAL_PICKUP_H1=The wheel on the machine at the rear of the study is finally turning fast enough for me to take what's inside!\r\nSTU_TRAIN_PLACE_WHEEL_H1=A model appeared out of the desk in the Study! It seems to be missing a wheel.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_COUPLING_ROD_H1=After I placed the wheel on the model train in the Study, the coupling rod was unlocked. I should be able to rotate it and connect the back wheels together.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BACK_WHEEL_PUZZLE_H1=I think the coupling rod on the rear wheels of the train in the Study are in the wrong position. It should probably be connected to the circular gold socket.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BACK_WHEEL_PUZZLE_H2=I can spin the gold dial to complete either path on the rear wheel. Moving the coupling rod along a completed path will let me turn both wheels together...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BACK_WHEEL_PUZZLE_H3=With the coupling rod at the end of a path, I should rotate both wheels one notch. I can then centre the rod, rotate the wheel back a notch, and repeat until the rod meets the gold socket.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BUFFER_PICKUP_H1=I small compartment opened on the side of the train in the Study. I should pick up the object inside.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BUFFER_PLACED_H1=This metal stud resembles something I've seen on the model train in the Study. \r\nSTU_TRAIN_BUFFER_PLACED_H2=The train is missing a buffer at the back, I wonder if the metal stud would fit?\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BUFFER_DRAWER_H1=I placed the buffer at the back of the train in the Study and a small drawer popped open. I should have a look inside.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_MAIN_ROD_PLACED_H1=There are two cross shaped sockets on the side of the train in the study; one on a wheel and the other on part of the piston. I think they're supposed to be connected by something. \r\nSTU_TRAIN_MAIN_ROD_PLACED_H2=I can use that metal rod I found to connect the wheel and piston on the train!\r\nSTU_TRAIN_COWCATCHER_PICKUP_H1=I should have a look inside the open hatch on the model train in the Study.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_COWCATCHER_INVENTORY_H1=The metal grille I have has a small handle on it that looks like it would rotate.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_COWCATCHER_PLACED_H1=Turning the handle on the the metal grille changed it's shape. I think it belongs somewhere on the train in the Study.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_COWCATCHER_PLACED_H2=The metal grille looks like a cowcatcher! I should see if it will fit onto the front of the train.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BARRELCAM_ROD_PICKUP_H1=There's an open compartment at the front of the train in the Study. I should see what's inside.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_CAM_ROD_PLACED_H1=The L-shaped connector I have looks like it fits somewhere on the train in the Study. One side of it has a triangular extrusion...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_CAM_ROD_PLACED_H2=There's a triangular socket above the trains piston! The L-shaped connector must fit there!\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SUPERZOOM_FACE_H1=A hatch opened up on the cabin door of the model train in the Study...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SUPERZOOM_FACE_H2=If I use my eyepiece I should be able to get a closer look inside the train's cabin.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_VALVE_COMBO_H1=There are a couple of valve wheels inside the cabin of the train in the Study. I should see what they do. \r\nSTU_TRAIN_VALVE_COMBO_H2=Turning a valve wheel makes part of the train's body rotate. It looks like something pops out of those holes in the body when they're at the top of the train.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_VALVE_COMBO_H3=It looks like I need to use the valve wheels to get the two holes in the train's body facing straight upwards. \r\nSTU_TRAIN_DOMES_COMBO_H1=There are two wheels protruding slightly out of the top of the model train in the Study, I should try turning them.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SMOKEBOX_DIALS_COMBO_H1=The domes sticking out the top of the model train in the Study have a curious shimmer, I should try examining them with my eyepiece.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SMOKEBOX_DIALS_COMBO_H2=The eyepiece has revealed some odd shapes in the domes. I think I need to view them from inside the cabin of the train to make any sense of them\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SMOKEBOX_DIALS_COMBO_H3=If I wear my eyepiece to look out the windows of the train cabin, I can discern two letters and two numbers. They must be used to unlock the smokebox at the front of the train!\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SMOKEBOX_HATCH_H1=I unlocked the smokebox at the front of the train in the Study! Now to see what's inside...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_WINDING_KEY_PICKUP_H1=There's a key inside the smokebox at the front of the train in the Study.\r\nSTU_TRAIN_FIREDOOR_H1=There's a firebox in the cabin of the train in the Study, but there's a grate in front of it. I think I can use that handle to open it. \r\nSTU_TRAIN_WINDING_KEY_RECEIVER_H1=Winding keys are normally used to wind up clockwork devices...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_WINDING_KEY_RECEIVER_H2=That model train in the Study must be mechanical. I wonder if it's winding mechanism is in the same place a real train would get its power...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_WINDING_KEY_RECEIVER_H3=In the cabin of the model train in the Study is a socket that looks just the right shape for the winding key!\r\nSTU_TRAIN_WINDING_KEY_H1=I've placed the winding key in the cabin of the model train in the Study, now I just need to wind it up...\r\nSTU_DESK_ROLLTOP_GEAR_SLIDER_H1=The model train in the Study is working! Is there a way for me to connect the gears underneath it?\r\nSTU_DESK_ROLLTOP_GEAR_SLIDER_H2=I need to lift that handle at the top of the roll top desk to raise the gear underneath the train.\r\nSTU_DESK_CHIMNEYBOX_BOLT_H1=The roll top desk opened up in the Study. I should investigate that trinket box in the corner.\r\nSTU_DESK_CHIMNEYBOX_LID_H1=I unlocked the trinket box in the roll top desk in the Study.

I can only see what's behind one of the panels at a time, though...\r\nSTU_DESK_SECTION_03_CODESPINNER_H2=The solution to the spinner behind the bottom panel must be behind the top one. I need to lock the bottom panel in place somehow... \r\nSTU_DESK_SECTION_03_CODESPINNER_H3=With both panels closed, I can use that deadbolt to lock the bottom one in place. I can then set each spinner to match the plaque directly above or below it.\r\nSTU_DESK_PHRENOLOGYHEADSEGMENT_PICKUP_H1=A drawer popped open on the roll top desk in the Study. I should take what's inside.\r\nSTU_TRAINPICTURE_RECEIVER_H1=I have a torn off section of a photo. Where's the rest of it?\r\nSTU_TRAINPICTURE_RECEIVER_H2=There's a photo of a train with a part missing in the Study. It must match the piece I have!\r\nSTU_DESK_COMBINATIONLOCK_H1=The photograph of the train above the desk has a strange shimmer to it. Perhaps my eyepiece would reveal something...\r\nSTU_DESK_COMBINATIONLOCK_H2=There are symbols on that dial on top of the roll top desk in the Study which match the ones on the train photo! I think the dial is some kind of combination lock...\r\nSTU_DESK_COMBINATIONLOCK_H3=Examining the photograph with my eyepiece reveals four symbols. This must be the correct combination to for the dial!\r\nSTU_DESK_MEDALLION=A medallion with four holes\r\nSTU_DESK_MEDALLION_CROSSWRENCH=A shaped metal piece\r\nSTU_GEAR_HANDLE=A crank handle\r\nSTU_TRIPLE_PIPE=A pipe connector\r\nSTU_TRIPLE_PIPE_PLACED_MESSAGE=It looks like it should connect - but something isn't right.\r\nSTU_WELL=Part of a model well\r\nSTU_MODEL_CHIMNEY=A model chimney\r\nSTU_MODEL_PUMP=The handle of a model pump\r\nSTU_PHRENOLOGY_SEGMENT=A strange enamel fragment \r\nSTU_COWCATCHER=A metal grille\r\nSTU_AEOLIPILE_TOO_HOT_TO_TOUCH=The metal is too hot to touch!\r\nSTU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_MESSAGE=There's something strange about that aperture...\r\nSTU_DESK_SUPERZOOM_EXAMINE=DOUBLE CLICK to examine the aperture\r\nSTU_TRAIN_COWCATCHER_MESSAGE=It seems like it should connect here - but it doesn't fit properly...\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BUFFER=A metal stud\r\nSTU_TRAIN_MAIN_ROD=A metal rod\r\nSTU_TRAIN_BARRELCAM_ROD=An L-shaped Connector\r\nSTU_TRAIN_KEY=A winding key\r\nSTU_FIRESTRIKER=A fire steel\r\nSTU_EYEBALL=An artificial eye\r\nSTU_TRAIN_SUPERZOOM_MESSAGE=That hatch...
